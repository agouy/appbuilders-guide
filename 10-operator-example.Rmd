# Walkthrough example: building the lm operator

Here we will learn through a concrete example how to create an R operator to perform a linear regression.

## Setting up the project {-}

**1. Designing the operator**

The first step is to define our input projection and outut relation. Remember: "Table in, Table out!"

Here we want to perform the linear regression of y against x in a cell. Our input is simple.

As a starting point, we will output the interecept and the slope of the model.

**2. Cloning the template repository**

Get the template from GitHub.
In RStudio server, File > New project > Version control.
URL: https://github.com/tercen/templateR_operator

Then, I have a new project at the root of my working directory.

**3. Resetting versioning and packrat**

Rename the files.
Reset the versioning and packrat.

## Coding the operator {-}

Coming soon.

* How an operator looks like

* Code description

```r
library(tercen)
library(dplyr)

do.lm <- function(df) {
  
  out <- data.frame(
    .ri = df$.ri[1],
    .ci = df$.ci[1],
    intercept = NaN,
    slope = NaN,
    fit.y = rep(NaN, 2),
    fit.x = rep(NaN, 2)
  )
  
  mod <- try(lm(.y ~ .x, data = df))
  
  if(!inherits(mod, 'try-error')) {
    out$intercept <- mod$coefficients[1]
    out$slope <- mod$coefficients[2]
    out$fit.y <- range(mod$fitted.values)
    out$fit.x <- range(df$.x)
  }
  return(out)
  
}

(ctx <- tercenCtx())  %>% 
  select(.x, .y, .ri, .ci) %>% 
  group_by(.ri, .ci) %>%
  do(do.lm(.)) %>%
  ctx$addNamespace() %>%
  ctx$save()
```

## Testing the operator locally {-}

Coming soon.

## Documenting {-}

Edit the README.md to describe the operator design and usage.

## Deploying the operator {-}

**main.R**

Coming soon.

**Init packrat**

Coming soon.

**Create and push repository**

Coming soon.

**Notify community**

Coming soon.
