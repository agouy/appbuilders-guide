# Building an R operator app: walkthrough example

Here we will learn through a concrete example how to create an R operator to perform a linear regression.

## Designing the operator {-}

The first step is to define our input projection and output relation. Remember that each operator works on tables:

> "Table in, table out!"

Here we want to perform the linear regression of y against x in per cell. Our input is simple. In this example, we will output the intercept and the slope of the model.

## Setting up the project {-}

Make sure that tercen-studio is properly set up (Chapter 2) and that both Tercen and RStudio run locally (respectively on http://127.0.0.1:5402 and http://127.0.0.1:8787/).

**1. Set up the tercen input projection**

We will use khan data.

* Pariwise projection of measurement in different tissues

* Look at the URL: (/w/WORKFLOWID/ds/DATASTEPID). It contains unique workflow and data step identififiers. These identifiers will be used in RStudio to communicate with this data step.

**2. Clone the template repository into RStudio**

Create a new repository with your own account based on the Tercen R operator template (https://github.com/tercen/templateR_operator). Click on the green button __Use this template__ in the template repository.

You will then be able to create your own repository base don this template. Give it an explicit name (here, `lm_operator`).

Now that the repository is initiated in your GitHub account, go back to RStudio Server. Create a new project by clicking on File > New project > Version control. You will be asked the URL of the repository, put the newly created one.


Includes:

* `main.R`

* `workspace.R`

* `doc`

**3. Set up the workspace**

* Start Tercen and use your browser to go to http://127.0.0.1:5400

* Login

* Go to the workflow which contains the data

* Add a data step

* Configure a project view in cross-tab window of the data step

```r
options("tercen.workflowId" = "wwww")
options("tercen.stepId"     = "dddd")
```

Rename the files.

**3. Reset and configure versioning**

In the terminal, run:

```bash
git remote -v
```

You can see that, as we imported the template from a GitHub repository, the.
We need to reset this configuration in order to push the operator we will create to the repository of our choice.


## Coding and testing the operator locally {-}


**Testing locally**

Tercen up and running with data step and appropriate input configured.

* Record the stepId and workflowId of this data step
    
* Get data using the tercen api tercen::ctx$select

* Execute the operator app locally

* Push results back to Tercen using the tercen API tercen::ctx$save

* Code description

```r
library(tercen)
library(dplyr)

do.lm <- function(df) {
  
  out <- data.frame(
    .ri = df$.ri[1],
    .ci = df$.ci[1],
    intercept = NaN,
    slope = NaN,
    fit.y = rep(NaN, 2),
    fit.x = rep(NaN, 2)
  )
  
  mod <- try(lm(.y ~ .x, data = df))
  
  if(!inherits(mod, 'try-error')) {
    out$intercept <- mod$coefficients[1]
    out$slope <- mod$coefficients[2]
    out$fit.y <- range(mod$fitted.values)
    out$fit.x <- range(df$.x)
  }
  return(out)
  
}

(ctx <- tercenCtx())  %>% 
  select(.x, .y, .ri, .ci) %>% 
  group_by(.ri, .ci) %>%
  do(do.lm(.)) %>%
  ctx$addNamespace() %>%
  ctx$save()
```

Implementing the following sanity checks is recommended when creating an operator:

* check the presence of expected inputs (here, x and y axes)

* add a try function to test the main function implemented (here, `lm`)

**Test in tercen**

## Documenting the operator {-}

Edit the README.md to describe the operator design and usage. The documentation should contain:

* A __general description__ of the operator

* A description of the __input projections__

* A description of the __output relations__

For example, here is how the `lm` operator documentation looks:

**Description**

The `lm` operator performs a linear regression in Tercen.

**Usage**

Input projection|
:--|:--
`y-axis`| measurement value
`x-axis`| explanatory value

Output relations|
:--|:--
`intercept`| numeric, intercept of the linear regression, per cell
`slope`| numeric, slope of the linear regression, per cell


**Details**

The `lm` operator performs a linear regression on each cell.

**References**

See [Linear regression on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression) and
`lm` [R function documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/lm).

## Preparing some unit testing

It's always good to prepare some tests to be ran for example during Tercen updates.

* subdirectory `test`

* input file

* expected output file

* `json` file describing the test

```r
# Simulate tercen input based on the CO2 dataset 
# with an x and y-axis, rows and columns
data(CO2)
df <- data.frame(.x = CO2$conc, .y = CO2$uptake, .ri = CO2$Plant, .ci = CO2$Treatment)

# Run the do.lm() function to generate the expected output
out <- df %>% select(.ci, .ri, .x, .y) %>%
  group_by(.ri, .ci) %>%
  do(do.lm(.))

# write input and expected output in the test subdirectory
write.csv(CO2, file="./test/CO2.csv", row.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE)
write.csv(out, file="./test/output.csv", row.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE)
```



## Deploying the operator {-}

**1. Copy the code to the main.R script**

Once you are confident enough that your operator is working after testing it locally, you can copy the code to the `main.R` file, ignoring the local stuff.

**2. Initiate renv**

The ability to run an operator with exactly the same packages you used when you developed is essential for reproducible science. In order to ensure reproducibility, you can associate packages and their versions to your operator by using the `init()` function of the `renv` package: 

```r
renv::init()
```

This will initiate a project-local environment with a private R library in the `renv` subdirectory.

**3. Push it to your GitHub repository**

Once everything is ready, you can push the modifications to your GitHub repository.

**4. Notify community**

Currently, we ask you to send an email to info@tercen.com containing the description and link to the __operators app__ git repository, Tercen support will manually test it and add it to the __app-library__ and thus allowing others to access it. We are currently building an web entry point for researchers to browse all the apps offered by the community.
