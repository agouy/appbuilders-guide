Why read this guide? : Your curious or wish to build an app for Tercen then this is the guide. Acknowledgement: I would like to thank all the users for their feedback. It has helped us improve Tercen. Feedback: If you wish to give feedback then please do not hesitate to create an entry in the issue tracker. Motivation: Tercen promotes collaboration for data analysis. Not everyone can code or even wants to, but everyone should benefit from the explosion of data and code currently taking place. Tercen allows non programmers (e.g. biologists) to explore their data and allows programmers (e.g. bioinformaticians) to upload their code (or web-apps) for the biologist to use. By offering this services we believe biologist get empowered and can claim back control of their data. The bioinformatician gets liberated from the operational details and day to day analysis demands from the biologist. This is summed up with the phrase: Tercen empowers the biologist and liberates the bioinformatician. "],
["apps-types.html", "Chapter 1 Apps types", " Chapter 1 Apps types So you want to build an app, or just plain curious. The first question to ask oneself is which type of Tercen app would you like to build. There are three main types: Template app Workflow app Operator app A researcher wanting a complete workflow data analysis (e.g. RNA-seq, flow cyto, etc.) chooses one of the workflows expressed as a list of template apps. A template app therefore represents the highest level app because it defines a set of many steps in sequence to achieve the complete analysis. There would be a template app for each of the high-level workflow (e.g. RNA-seq, flow cyto, etc.). A researcher wanting a specific statistical process (e.g. quality control, two group analysis, or enrichment analysis, etc.) chooses from a list of workflow apps. A workflow app therefore represents the second highest level app because it defines a focused set of steps and visuals to achieve one particular statistical objective. A researcher wanting a specific operator function (e.g. scale, log, multiplication, addition and subtraction, etc.) chooses from a list of operator apps. An Operator app therefore represents a single computational step. In summary a research wishing a full end-to-end workflow chooses a template app, a specific data process chooses a workflow app, a specific computation chooses an operator app. Once an app is built, it may be added to the app-library where it can be accessed by researchers. Deciding on which to build is determined by what you would like the app to achieve. The first two, template and workflow, do not need programming experience, the operator does. Each has its own building process. Workflows and template apps are built and deployed within Tercen while an operator app is written using any number of programming languages (R, Python, Rust, etc.). The code is put on git hub for the app library to find. Currently Tercen has made a convenient R package for working with the Tercen API, we aim to quickly cover the other languages during our final release. The building of each app is explained in the following chapters. "],

For templates and workflow apps you do not need a development environment as Tercen contains all the features required to build them.
