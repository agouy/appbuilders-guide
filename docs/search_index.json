Why read this guide? : Your curious or wish to build an app for Tercen then this is the guide. Acknowledgement: I would like to thank all the users for their feedback. It has helped us improve Tercen. Feedback: If you wish to give feedback then please do not hesitate to create an entry in the issue tracker. Motivation: Tercen promotes collaboration for data analysis. Not everyone can code or even wants to, but everyone should benefit from the explosion of data and code currently taking place. Tercen allows non programmers (e.g. biologists) to explore their data and allows programmers (e.g. bioinformaticians) to upload their code (or web-apps) for the biologist to use. By offering this services we believe biologist get empowered and can claim back control of their data. The bioinformatician gets liberated from the operational details and day to day analysis demands from the biologist. This is summed up with the phrase: Tercen empowers the biologist and liberates the bioinformatician. "],
["apps-types.html", "Chapter 1 Apps types", " Chapter 1 Apps types So you want to build an app, or just plain curious. First question is which type of Tercen app would like to build. There are three main types of Tercen apps: Template app Workflow app Operator app Deciding on which to build is determined by what you would like the app to achieve. The first two do not need programming experience, the last does. Each has its own building process. Workflows and Template apps are built and deployed with Tercen while operators are built using a variety of programming languages. A workflow app performs higher level analysis, examples quality control analysis two group comparison analysis enrichment analysis A workflow app is very much a modular workflow, while an operator app is aimed for a single computational step. An operator app performs a simple specific computational function, examples: log function scale function addition subtraction An operator app is written using a variety of programming languages (R, Python, Rust). The code is put on git hub for the app library to find. Currently Tercen supports R in our beta version but our we aim to quickly cover the other languages during our final release. "],

All the operators apps are version controlled. "],

["next-steps.html", "Chapter 6 Next steps", " Chapter 6 Next steps Here are some ideas: Try to code for different operators using the teRcen R package, Note when using R Studio it will auto-complete when you type the methods on the Tercen client and tercen query object.

Variable: A variable is a characteristic of a unit being observed that may assume more than one of a set of values to which a numerical measure or a category from a classification can be assigned (e.g. income, age, weight, etc., and “occupation”, “industry”, “disease”, etc Table: Cross-tab window: Projection: Long format: Wide format: "]
