Why read this guide? : If you would like to create an app for Tercen then this is the guide. Acknowledgement: I would like to thank all the users for their feedback. It has helped us improve Tercen. Feedback: If you wish to give feedback then please do not hesitate to create an entry in the issue tracker. Motivation: Tercen promotes collaboration for data analysis. Not everyone can code or even wants to, but everyone should benefit from the explosion of data and code currently taking place. Tercen allows non programmers (e.g. biologists) to explore their data and allows programmers (e.g. bioinformaticians) to upload their code (or web-apps) for the biologist to use. By offering this services we believe biologist get empowered and can claim back control of their data. The bioinformatician gets liberated from the operational details and day to day analysis demands from the biologist. This is summed up with the phrase: Tercen empowers the biologist and liberates the bioinformatician. "],
["introduction-1.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction So you want to build an app. It is important to releaize there are two main types of apps: * operator app * workflow app An each has its own building process. Workflow are build with Tercen while operators are build using a variety of programming languages. An operator app perfroms a simple spectific computational function, examples: * log function * scale function * addition * substration A workflow app performs higher level analysis, examples quality control analysis two group comparision analysis enrichment analysis A workflow app is very much a modular workflow, while an operator app is aimed at one computation step. An operator is written using a varity of programming languages (R, Python, Rust). The code is put on github for the app library to find. Currently Tercen supports R in our beta version but our we aim to quickly cover the other languages during our final release. "],

Variable: A variable is a characteristic of a unit being observed that may assume more than one of a set of values to which a numerical measure or a category from a classification can be assigned (e.g. income, age, weight, etc., and “occupation”, “industry”, “disease”, etc Table: Cross-tab window: Projection: Long format: Wide format: "]
