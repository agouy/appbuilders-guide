Why read this guide? : Your curious or wish to build an app for Tercen then this is the guide. Acknowledgement: I would like to thank all the users for their feedback. It has helped us improve Tercen. Feedback: If you wish to give feedback then please do not hesitate to create an entry in the issue tracker. Motivation: Tercen promotes collaboration for data analysis. Not everyone can code or even wants to, but everyone should benefit from the explosion of data and code currently taking place. Tercen allows non programmers (e.g. biologists) to explore their data and allows programmers (e.g. bioinformaticians) to upload their code (or web-apps) for the biologist to use. By offering this services we believe biologist get empowered and can claim back control of their data. The bioinformatician gets liberated from the operational details and day to day analysis demands from the biologist. This is summed up with the phrase: Tercen empowers the biologist and liberates the bioinformatician. "],
["apps-types.html", "Chapter 1 Apps types", " Chapter 1 Apps types So you want to build an app, or just plain curious. The first question to ask oneself is which type of Tercen app would you like to build. There are three main types: Template app Workflow app Operator app A researcher wanting a complete workflow data analysis (e.g. RNA-seq, flow cyto, etc.) chooses one of the workflows expressed as a list of template apps. A template app therefore represents the highest level app because it defines a set of many steps in sequence to achieve the complete analysis. There would be a template app for each of the high-level workflow (e.g. RNA-seq, flow cyto, etc.). A researcher wanting a specific statistical process (e.g. quality control, two group analysis, or enrichment analysis, etc.) chooses from a list of workflow apps. A workflow app therefore represents the second highest level app because it defines a focused set of steps and visuals to achieve one particular statistical objective. A researcher wanting a specific operator function (e.g. scale, log, multiplication, addition and subtraction, etc.) chooses from a list of operator apps. An Operator app therefore represents a single computational step. In summary a research wishing a full end-to-end workflow chooses a template app, a specific data process chooses a workflow app, a specific computation chooses an operator app. Once an app is built, it may be added to the app-library where it can be accessed by researchers. Deciding on which to build is determined by what you would like the app to achieve. The first two, template and workflow, do not need programming experience, the operator does. Each has its own building process. Workflows and template apps are built and deployed within Tercen while an operator app is written using any number of programming languages (R, Python, Rust, etc.). The code is put on git hub for the app library to find. Currently Tercen has made a convenient R package for working with the Tercen API, we aim to quickly cover the other languages during our final release. The building of each app is explained in the following chapters. "],

If you are a regular programmer then you already have your environment. For templates and workflow apps you do not need a development environment as Tercen contains all the features required to build them. Installing tercen-studio Install docker-compose for Linux or Windows or Mac. For Windows: First, install Docker-Desktop for Windows. Important: Make sure the Enable Hyper-V Windows Features option is selected on the Configuration page. Then, you can start Docker Desktop and get tercen-studio. Clone the following repository git clone https://github.com/tercen/tercen_studio.git cd tercen_studio Activate shared drives right click on the running docker service and select “settings” &gt; “shared drives” share the folder tercen_studio For Mac: Coming soon. For Linux: Coming soon. Starting tercen-studio Then you can start tercen by running: docker-compose up -d You can run Tercen by going to http://127.0.0.1:5402. Username: admin Password: admin You can run RStudio by going to http://127.0.0.1:8787/. Username: rstudio Password: tercen Now you’re all set!

["building-an-r-operator-app.html", "Chapter 5 Building an R operator app Creating an operator app Notify the community R packrat", " Chapter 5 Building an R operator app Creating an operator app Tercen allows programmers to easily build new operators from the comfort of their favorite interactive development environment (IDE). From the IDE it is possible to access all Tercen features. The ability to access the input data (from Tercen) and returning results (to Tercen) is essential. The ability to create a new Tercen operator requires basic programming skills. Here is a development process to create an operator app: Design the operator: Creating the project: Open R Studio and create an empty project and init the git Copy four files into project, you can find them in any operator in tercen github. operator.json main.R README.md .gitignore Modify appropriately each of the files Create the workspace.R file by: Copy main.R and rename to workspace.R file Add the following lines to workspace.R file: source(&#39;~/.Rprofile&#39;) options(&quot;tercen.workflowId&quot;= &quot;76a4dcffd551802fd23d42bd862e8300&quot;) options(&quot;tercen.stepId&quot;= &quot;3-2&quot;) The values indicated above are examples. The real values come from the next section. Writing and testing the operator app: Develop and test the operator app within the workspace.R file Determine the input data for the operator app Start Tercen Use the browser to go to http://127.0.0.1:5400 Login Go to the workflow which contains the data Add a data step Configure a project view in cross-tab window of the data step Record the stepId and workflowId of this data step Get data using the tercen api tercen::ctx$select Execute the operator app locally Push results back to Tercen using the tercen API tercen::ctx$save The actions above may happen multiple times as you develop your operator. Once the operator app is finalized then proceed: Deploy the operator: Modify workshop.R and copy it to main.R Run packrat::init This can always re-init packrat by performing the following Remove the packrat folder in the Rstudio project folder Remove the .Rprofile file in the project folder Run packrat::init again upload to github in a public repository, let call it the operator git repo. The process steps for building a operator app using R: Design the operator Decide which existing operator to clone from Tercen app-library Clone an existing operator from the Tercen github Re-init the git Remove packrat Modify the code for operator Run it locally until satisfied Add some tests Add documentation Init the R packrat Create and push to a git repository Install it into Tercen from app-library Test it on data Notify the community it exists (see below) The building and deployment steps are performed in your development environment (e.g. R Studio) and Git hub. All the operators apps are version controlled. All operator apps who are on a git repository are installable, only the git URL and a tag version number is required for a researcher to install it in Tercen. Notify the community Currently, we ask you to send an email to info@tercen.com containing the description and link to the operators app git repository, Tercen support will manually test it and add it to the app-library and thus allowing others to access it. We are currently building an web entry point for researchers to browse all the apps offered by the community. R packrat R operators require packages, especially the same version of packages you used when you developed. This package environment is managed by (packrat[https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/] system is used to manage package versions.. The ability to run an operator with exactly the same packages you used when you developed is essential for reproducible science. "],

Setting up the project 1. Designing the operator The first step is to define our input projection and outut relation. Remember: “Table in, Table out!” Here we want to perform the linear regression of y against x in a cell. Our input is simple. As a starting point, we will output the interecept and the slope of the model. 2. Cloning the template repository Get the template from GitHub. In RStudio server, File &gt; New project &gt; Version control. URL: https://github.com/tercen/templateR_operator Then, I have a new project at the root of my working directory. 3. Resetting versioning and packrat Rename the files. Reset the versioning and packrat. Coding the operator Coming soon.
