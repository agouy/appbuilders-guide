# Setting up the environment

if you wish to develop __operators__ then you require to have a programming development environment.
If you are a regular programmer then you already have your environment.

For __templates__ and __workflow apps__ you do not need a development environment as Tercen contains all the features required to build them.

## Setting up R {-}

* install R
* modify your .RProfile, this is optional
* install an IDE (e.g. R Studio)
* install the tercen r package

You are ready to go.

## .RProfile definition

__Content of `.Rprofile:` file in your home directory__ 
```
options("tercen.serviceUri"="http://127.0.0.1:5400/api/v1/")
options("tercen.username"="XXXX")
options("tercen.password"="YYYY")
```
where `XXXX` and `YYYY` are the appropriate username and password of the developer.


## Setting up Python, for example {-}

* install Python
* install your favorite IDE
* access Tercen via the API
