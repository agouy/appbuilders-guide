# Building an operator app

The process steps for building a operator app is:

* Design
* Decide which existing operator to clone from Tercen app-library
* Clone an existing operator
* Re-init the git
* Remove packrat
* Modify the operator
* Run it locally until satisfied
* Add some tests
* Modify and Add some doc
* Init packrat
* Push it a git repository
* Modify the app-library repository (publish)
* Install it into Tercen from app-library
* Test it on data
* Notify the community it exists

The building and deployment steps are performed in your development environment (e.g. R Studio) and Git hub.

All the operators apps are version controlled.
