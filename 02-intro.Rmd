# Introduction

So you want to build an app.  It is important to releaize there are two main types of apps:
* operator app
* workflow app

An each has its own building process. Workflow are build with Tercen while operators are build using a variety of programming languages.

An operator app perfroms a simple spectific computational function, examples:
* log function
* scale function
* addition
* substration

A workflow app performs higher level analysis, examples

* quality control analysis
* two group comparision analysis
* enrichment analysis

A workflow app is very much a modular workflow, while an operator app is aimed at one computation step.

An operator is written using a varity of programming languages (R, Python, Rust). The code is put on github for the app library to find. 
Currently Tercen supports R in our beta version but our we aim to quickly cover the other languages during our final release.
