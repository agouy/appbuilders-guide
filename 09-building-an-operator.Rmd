# Building an R operator app

The process steps for building a __operator app__ using R:

* Design the __operator__
* Decide which existing operator to clone from Tercen __app-library__
* Clone an existing __operator__ from the Tercen github
* Re-init the git
* Remove packrat
* Modify the code for __operator__
* Run it locally until satisfied
* Add some tests
* Add documentation
* Init the R packrat
* Create and push to a git repository
* Install it into Tercen from __app-library__
* Test it on data
* Notify the community it exists (see below)

The building and deployment steps are performed in your development environment (e.g. R Studio) and Git hub.

All the operators apps are version controlled.

All __operator apps__ who are on a git repository are installable, only the git URL and a tag version number is required for a researcher to install it in Tercen.


## Notify the community {-}

Currently, we ask you to send an email to info@tercen.com containing the description and link to the __operators app__  git repository, Tercen support will manually test it and add it to the __app-library__ and thus allowing others to access it. We are currently building an web entry point for researchers to browse all the apps offered by the community.
